# Setting up a DNS

How to set-up your ENS domain (i.e. unicorn.eth) so it can issue subdomains (i.e. alex.unicorn.eth). You must be on the Growth tier or above to do this.


## Steps

### 1. Update Resolver in the ENS App

In the ENS App, go to your domain and click on the "More" tab. At the bottom you'll find the Resolver, click Edit.

Update the Resolver address to: 0xF12d6Aa997F7c9Fc2E8968A19623211e8C8C1bF4
