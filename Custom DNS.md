# Linking a custom DNS

How to deploy your Unicorn WebApp to a custom DNS domain (i.e. www.community.com). You must be on the Growth tier or above to do this.

## Steps

### 1. Add a CNAME record

Go to your domain registrar (i.e. Go Daddy, Namecheap, etc.) and a new record:
  
  a. Type: CNAME
  
  b. Name: *
  
  c. Value: cname.unicorn-account.com
